## Description

_Make a program for users to catalog and organize their music. This could be a CD, vinyl or even a tape collection._

* They should be able to create a new record, enter the record title, and list out all of their records.
* Add a feature that allows users to add an artist to a record.
* After that, let users list out all the artists and choose an artist to see which records are by that artist.
* Create another link on the home page to take the user to a "/search_by_artist" page. Users should be able to fill out a form with an artist name to search for their collection. After submitting the form they should be taken to a page listing out all the records they own by that artist.
